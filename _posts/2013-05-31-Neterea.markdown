When starting a project, or a company, timing is as important as the people involved.
Sometimes you know the right people but they have their own jobs. Eventually, when they are
ready to jump in, you are the one with professional commitments.

Neterea Studios started a long time ago, just as a mere vision. And therefore, the core team
members still had a long path to walk before they could join again and start thinking of
Neterea Studios as a real project.

Finally we have the opportunity to work in this business as a company and create the videogames
we always wanted.

<p>
Hard work is all that lies ahead.

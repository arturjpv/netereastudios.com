The same day of the presentation, Neterea Studios, became a member of PAD (Professional Associated Developers).
</p>

<p>
As you can read on the <a href="http://www.padweb.org" target="_blank">official website</a>: PAD is a non lucrative, open, active, inclusive,
horizontal and transparent organization with the goal of fulfilling the real needs of the independent (indie) video game developer.

<p>
These are great news for independent game developers in Spain. With 40 companies already in, we hope this means a stronger industry with more and better games.
